what i did:
- just did the layout
- fixed edging glitch (ex. column 5 row 1 can be transferred to column 1 row 2 if latter is empty)
- foundation code for separate pages (done via tk.frame)
- adaptive resolution changes (can be opened on a lower resolution pc and will look the same as 1920x1080)
- removed window resize permission
- placed the entire grid puzzle sliding thing under a class (just use {CLASSNAME}.{FUNCTIONNAME}({ARGUMENTS}) to call it)
- blue is for difficulty rating placeholder
- green is for timer placeholder
  
PS
there may be legacy code in the project
